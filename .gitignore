# When this repository is included as a
# submodule within a buildout project,
# buildout will dump a .egg-info directory
# into this directory causing the submodule
# to become "dirty", and this shows up
# as a change to track in the parent repository.
# Therefore, we ignore *.egg-info at the
# repository level.
